## 🌑 Rupture and Flow
- Stomach cramps at night — not hunger, but stress/resistance.  
- Early sleep → reset → woke positive.  
- Universal Credit arriving → Tesco’s bread & butter secured.  
- Tobacco/weed pipeline: hesitation, unreliable contacts, police presence.  
- Decision: set new pipeline closer to home, patient, aligned.  
- Energetic ambience felt right → within hours, provision secured.  
- Reflection: mirrored digital practice of architecture in space.

## 🎯 Epiphany at the Dartboard
- Found best darts ever (amazing grip) → higher level of play.  
- Shifted from treble 20 to bull.  
- Realization: aiming at bull with certain angle aligns with board’s geometry.  
- Higher shot percentage without obsessing over numbers.  
- Variation allowed — no need to repeat exact throw.  
- Principle: **reduce score quickly, trust energetic flow, release fixation.**

---

## ♟️ Analogy to Speed Chess
- Speed chess: stop caring about each move, see energetic throw across the board.  
- Darts: same principle — angle and flow matter more than target fixation.  
- Threshold of mastery: calculation dissolves into embodied geometry.  
- Success = trusting rhythm, not chasing outcomes.

## 🍻 Pub Encounter — Mirror of Insight
- Met man who couldn’t read, not bound by numbers or letters.  
- He showed resilience: doing well without school anchors.  
- His life mirrored darts insight: non-attachment, flow, agency.  
- Realization: not about teaching, but recognition.  
- Collapse of letters into sound — phonetic riff inscribed as sovereign evidence.  
- **Archive doesn’t just hold words, it holds the moment they dissolve into sound.**  
- **Voice doesn’t just witness the dissolve, it creates it.**
