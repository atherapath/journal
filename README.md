# 📖 AtheraPath Journal

Welcome to the **AtheraPath Journal** —  
a living library of glyphs created by contributors across the Path.

Every creator who submits a glyph begins their own **Journal** —  
a personal page that grows as they publish more glyphs through **KittyKat**.

## 🧩 How Your Journal Works

Each Journal page is built with the same **page-weaver** format used across AtheraPath.  
That means it’s made up of three (or sometimes four) matching files:

```
your_name.html
your_name.md
your_name.jpg
your_name.mp4   ← optional short clip displayed beneath the image
```

The `.mp4` file is optional — it’s your way to add motion, ambience, or sound to your glyph.  
When present, it plays automatically beneath your main image in a short, silent loop.  

All files share the same root name — that’s what ties them together as one glyph.  
The page-weaver system handles loading, rendering, and layout automatically.

## 🪶 Journal Layout

At the top of your Journal page, you’ll see:

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Author** | Your display name |
| **Contact** | Your email address (the one you entered through KittyKat) |

Below that lives your **Journal Feed** —  
a flowing section showing your most recent glyphs.  

Each glyph preview displays:  
- an **image thumbnail** on the left,  
- a **short text excerpt** on the right.  

Two glyphs appear side-by-side, and the list scrolls smoothly through your latest six creations.  
If you’ve made fewer than six glyphs, it shows however many exist — one to six.

## 🔁 Latest Six & Archive

At the bottom of the feed you’ll see a button:

> **“View Archive”**

This opens your personal **Glyph Archive**,  
listing *all* of your published glyphs in date order.

The same system powers the main **AtheraPath landing page**,  
which shows the six most recent glyphs across *all* authors —  
a shared, scrolling window into the living web.

## 🛠️ How It’s Connected

Every Journal runs on the same shared theme and JavaScript engine (`page-weaver.js`).  
That means:

- Your Markdown (`.md`) handles your words.  
- Your image (`.jpg`) represents your glyph visually.  
- Your video (`.mp4`) adds motion beneath the image.  
- Your HTML (`.html`) ties it all together dynamically.

When you create or edit glyphs using **KittyKat**,  
your Journal page updates automatically to reflect your latest work.
