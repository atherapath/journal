<summary>1st - 01:55 ⛳ New Level Creating 🎚️

</summary>

Created a new MD file for week 49 and started with a poem and some pictures. Feeling on a creative high because of the freedom I've given myself and the fun it was to do. 

![0112251](0112251.jpg)

[creative freedom](0112251.jpg)

A lot of the last few weeks has been about testing workflows , trying to work out what i need to develop to get me the space to create digitally. 

>Sometimes it's about developing my workflow and sometimes it's about developing a product.  It's sort of turning into one of the same thing . [#captain](#captain)

Everytime i tried to organise for a book i just felt there should be better than "platforms" to get my thoughts out and turn them into multimedia online.

```
A river of workflows flowing under a bridge of platforms and policies with a "bridge here to submit" sign pointing to infrastructure.

```

***The image prompt i want to use with mobile broadband, because that's the only useful broadband i can get on my phone unless i get to the pub and get wi-fi which i could do to be honest so might go get some wi-fi, night coffee, as a good idea***

Nevermind i seem to have managed it without the mobile broadband or maybe very little of it 

- just another generator
- put frame on it which is more of text around it

- > ok pilot can't you understand the english language translator into text to do it for me ok give me the css i need to line to go and i need to know where to put it i need to know desperately how to boreder around my images so my images on the css i need a neon green perfect border highly detailed fluctuating gradient on every image every every single image i guess blast on the side as i said every image i just need every single image to have this boarder so i hasn't got to think about it think about and i know it's always good like no 🙂‍↔️ matter what the picture is the borders is always good but you can't stop looking at the image because the border is so good and even if the images are s*** the border is unbelievable

>So that's why i need to css for css update will do this copilot you know you can do it for me you know it's too lines of code and you know i need it now.

<summary>🎱 deep ai.org review 🕵️</summary>

>The recording device is working well over mobile broadband, with non-intrusive ads that require user interaction to continue. The process of stopping the recording after closing ads helps ensure intentional use. Overall, the service appears to meet basic expectations.

>It's the first time I've used it however it did allow to operate twice and generally doing two things in a row for me in inside a web browser and no bandwith fluctuation happening.  Needs further testing.
