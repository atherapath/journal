<summary>1st - 01:55 ⛳ New Level Creating 🎚️

</summary>

Created a new MD file for week 49 and started with a poem and some pictures. Feeling on a creative high because of the freedom I've given myself and the fun it was to do. 

![0112251](0112251.jpg)

[creative freedom](0112251.jpg)

A lot of the last few weeks has been about testing workflows , trying to work out what i need to develop to get me the space to create digitally. 

>Sometimes it's about developing my workflow and sometimes it's about developing a product.  It's sort of turning into one of the same thing . [#captain](#captain)

Everytime i tried to organise for a book i just felt there should be better than "platforms" to get my thoughts out and turn them into multimedia online.

```
A river of workflows flowing under a bridge of platforms and policies with a "bridge here to submit" sign pointing to infrastructure.

```

***The image prompt i want to use with mobile broadband, because that's the only useful broadband i can get on my phone unless i get to the pub and get wi-fi which i could do to be honest so might go get some wi-fi, night coffee, as a good idea***

Nevermind i seem to have managed it without the mobile broadband or maybe very little of it 

- just another generator
- put frame on it which is more of text around it

<summary>3rd - 10:46 ⚠️ AI Attack ⚠️</summary>

>I finally reached point where i feel i have the digital tools and housing to represent me in the way i want to create and present a book in the world we live in today.  [#captain](#captain)

Showing the survival of sovereign concept into digital form.

[Instant manifestation by deepai.org](0312251.jpg)

This all started with a book or concept i had called AI attack.  I start trying create with words and pictures and music in a digital space for this book and the irony is the writing proves it.  

***Naming struggle in the***

- writing
- dictating
- presenting 
- housing 
- securing 
- financing 

The ache that comes from trying to do that consistently for fun and for free.  In a sense you could say the book or concept started writing itself.

***Sovereign Voice - silent remedy - the healing is in the naming.***

![0312252](0312252.jpg)

[Heat sound light](0312252.jpg) 🕯️ 🚨

#### The sovereign voice dictates,
>names and archives the struggle.  The book is the name, the struggle is the book, the voice is the struggle the struggle is the sovereign. [#captain](#captain)

#### Or as the buddha
>life is suffering

#### Suffering with art 🎨 🎭 
The whole definition of what a book is or means too me and how I want to use a digital space to present or "represent" myself....***Starts to change***
