## 24-Hour tax Loop

I Have created a reality for myself 
- One I can essentially 
- Dictate and publish my voice into a digital space 
- Presented in a pleasurable way to look at with images 
- And potentially videos 
- And Potentially A lot of text

### What about where I pay for it???

Ah yes....bless your heart...(◕♡◕)

You are the victim of what we call the 24-hour tax Loop (>‿♥)  
  
***Within the space of 24 hours***  
  
You will have a certain amount of bandwidth and or battery life available to you on any mobile device.

We could go into all the metrics but ultimately none of them really make any sense. So really all you need to know is that the more tax you pay and the closer you are to establishments with signal that do pay tax. The better time You'll have in terms of keeping your battery charged and accessing available ***Locally Cached*** applications on your mobile phone.
